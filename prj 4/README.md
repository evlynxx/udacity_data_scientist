# Starbucks - scheduling promotion strategy using Machine Learning
This project schedules a smart and simple promotional strategy for Starbucks where firstly we analyse simulated data of the Starbucks Rewards mobile app and then we prepare machine learning models to predict individual offer portfolios to each customer.

It asks and answers following business questions:

1. Can we find relationships between customer demographic group age and income?
2. How are offer types distributed in data set related to customer demographics age, income and gender?
3. Which are the most popular offers?
4. Are there significant differences in age, income and registration date for promotion success?
5. Can we build a classification model to predict promotional offer success for new customers based on their demographical data age, income, registration date and gender?
