# Analysis of Diabetic Patient Data

## Installations
 - Pandas
 - Matplotlib
 - Seaborn
 - NumPy

## Project Motivation
This dataset is originally from the **National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.** The dataset consist of several medical predictor **(independent)** variables and one target **(dependent)** variable - Outcome. 

Independent variables include:

- Number of times pregnant.
- Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
- Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
- Two-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
- Diabetes pedigree function.
- Age (years).
- Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1).

Questions:

1. Is there a relationship between age & diabetes?
2. Is there a relationship between number of pregnancies & diabetes?
3. Are people with high blood pressure prone to diabetes? 
4. Are obese people prone to diabetes? (BMI > 30)

I wanted the opportunity to explore the data and communicate my findings via a blog post on Medium in what is hopefully an engaging post which gives the reader insight into the questions posed. 

## File Descriptions
There is one exploratory notebook available here to showcase my work related to the questions posed. Markdown cells were used throughout to explain the process taken.

## Medium Blog Post 
The main findings of the code can be found at the Medium Blog post available [here](https://medium.com/@chuminhlu/patterns-found-in-the-diabetic-patient-dataset-6ad2bce47524)
